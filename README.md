# Number-Characteristics
Requirements

The code I’ve provided in the Program.cs file reads in the number and stores it in an int variable named number. Your evaluation must use the value in that variable.

Your solution must do the following:

Print e if the number is even and o if the number is odd

Print a space

Print -1 if the number is negative, 0 if the number is 0, and 1 if the number is positive

All of the above should be on a single line of output. For example, if the number is -2, your output should be the following on a single line :

e -1

We’d typically label our output to tell the user what the output means, but that will just confuse the automated grader. You must print ONLY the values described above in your output, with the values appearing on a single line with a single space between them.

Running Your Code

Because of the code I included to work with the automated grader on Coursera, when you run your program the command prompt window will open and it will sit there doing nothing. To make your code run, type in an integer and press the <Enter> key; your code should then run so you can check your output. For example, your input could be: 

2

You can actually run your code again if you want to by typing in an integer and pressing the <Enter> key again. When you’re ready to stop running your code, type q (for quit).

Here's what running the code multiple times with different inputs should look like (remember, you're including a newline at the end of each of your output lines). The first line is the integer input, the second line is your output line, and so on:    

-2

e -1

1

o 1

q
